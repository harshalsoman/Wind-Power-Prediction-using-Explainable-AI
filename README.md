# Wind-Power-Prediction-using-Explainable-AI

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and predicting wind power generation using machine learning techniques. It also involves exploration of explanability techniques to gaze why the model is predicting what its predicting.The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, leveraging libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone  https://github.com/harshalsoman/Wind-Power-Prediction-using-Explainable-AI.git
    ```

## Analysis and Results
The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Data Loading: Loads the wind power data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the data to understand its distribution and relationships.
4. Model Training: Trains a machine learning model to predict wind power generation.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
6. Explainability

### Key Metrics:
- **Coefficient of Determination (R-squared):** -0.55
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 0.26
